# MLaaS vs MLOps


I watched this interesting video regarding the differences of MLOps (e.g. Train, Serve, Monitor your own model) vs ML-as-a-Service (e.g. Foundation Models).

These are some interesting learning points:

- MLaaS tend to be more B2C and MLOps is mainly B2B
- Foundation Models have pushed the MLOps Frameworks to emphasize on the software's ability to perform fine-tuning
- MLOps revenue generation is not as fast as MLaaS but the contracts and projects are bigger
- MLOps tends to lean towards providing for instances of Proprietary Data.
