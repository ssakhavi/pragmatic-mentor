I&rsquo;ve been on a few projects up until now and gathered a lot of experience.
My journey, however, is far from over and I have many things to learn.</p>
<h2 id=what-am-i-suppose-to-do>What am I suppose to do?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-am-i-suppose-to-do>#</a></h2>
<p>I remember when I started my job, I asked my supervisor: What is my role as a &ldquo;Senior Engineer&rdquo;?
Am I a &ldquo;<em>Tech Lead</em>&rdquo;? Am I an &ldquo;<em>Engineering Manager</em>&rdquo;? What am I suppose to be doing?</p>
<p>At that time, I shared with him a great blog post by Pat Kua on the topic of <a href=https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes>different types of

out that my responsibility is to be <strong>Tech Lead EM</strong> for the project. At the time, it was kind of a
