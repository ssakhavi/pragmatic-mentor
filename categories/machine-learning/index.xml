<p>These are some interesting learning points:</p>
<ul>
<li>MLaaS tend to be more B2C and MLOps is mainly B2B</li>
<li>Foundation Models have pushed the MLOps Frameworks to emphasize on the software&rsquo;s ability to perform fine-tuning</li>
<li>MLOps revenue generation is not as fast as MLaaS but the contracts and projects are bigger</li>
<li>MLOps tends to lean towards providing for instances of Proprietary Data.</li>
</ul>

I want to clarify I have no intention of using this technology for monotization. I&rsquo;ve used it for generating knowledge and nothing else.
Functional Frameworks Are a Thing Q: I&rsquo;ve been noticing machine learning frameworks such as JAX and functorch have been adopting functional programming paradigms. Is this true?
Yes, it&rsquo;s true that some machine learning frameworks are adopting functional programming paradigms. This is because functional programming can help make it easier to write code that is concise, modular, and reusable, which can be useful when working on large machine learning projects.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
