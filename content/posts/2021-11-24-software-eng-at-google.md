In my last post, I was shared what my concerns were regarding software development and
what my role as a Tech Lead should look at AISG.

Today, I had an awesome find!

## One thing led to another

I was looking at my youtube subscriptions, and I saw video posted
on the ["Dev Interrupted" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP37Olcw_x_-4FBGdQlcYIw).
If you aren't subscribed to it, I highly recommend it. I recall I found the channel when
Luca Rossi, the owner of the amazing ["Refactoring"](https://refactoring.fm/) newsletter, mentioned
it in one of the issues of his newsletter (Thanks Luca!).

The video, titled [Evaluating and Understanding Constraints in Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70tFglJMkQw)
was actually a clip from a [podcast interview](https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/lessons-learned-from-programming-at-google-part-1/)
in June 2021. The title of the video didn't click with me at first. When I opened it and listened. They were talking about
constraints that are needed during software engineering (something I personally believe in).

I searched the names of the interviewees and found out they were the authors of the book
**"Software Engineering at Google"**. I can't tell you how many times I'd seen this book on
different websites and how much I wanted to read it. Unfortunately, I would always de-prioritize
it on my reading list. I went to the book on my O'Reilly account, opened the TOC and then,
my jaw dropped. The TOC was almost all of the things I wrote down in [my previous post](../being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg) and more.

To my amazement, the book is also shared for free on their [website](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book).

## How am I going to go from here?
This new finding is very precious. In my coming posts, I'll be using elements of the book
and also, other books that I have access to or purchased.

My main goal would be to define the processes and practices from the point of view of a 
Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead @AISG.
