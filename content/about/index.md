My name is Siavash (See-ya-vash) Sakhavi. Nice to meet you!

I am Iranian, Married, Have two children, and live in Singapore.

## How would I describe myself?

**I'm a resourceful person** due to reading and digesting of topic spanning from Software Engineering, to Machine Learning, to Project Management.

**I always like a new challenge** and constantly try to learn and implement new technologies. For example, I'm interested in Functional Programming and Declerative Programming and how machine learning code can borrow the concepts.

**I question concepts** and ways things are implemented and try to find better ways for them to work in the situation I have.

## Acedemic Background

I was a Biomedical Engineering (Bio-Electrics) student at Amirkabir university of technology during my bachelors. My Project Supervisor during this time was Dr.VahidReza Nafisi. My focus was designing and developing a system for recording and analyzing wrist pulse signals based on traditional Iranian medicine.

For my masters I was at Sharif University of Technology under the supervision of Dr.Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi, a guru in the field if Signal Processing and  Time-Frequency Analysis. My project was designing a Error-Potential Based Task for BCI applications.

For my PhD, I was part of at joint PhD program between A\*STAR and NUS. I was mainly based in the Brain-Computer Interface Lab @ A\*STAR. I was working under the supervision of Dr. Guan Cuntai and Dr. Yan Shuicheng. My thesis is on the application of Deep Learning Methods in Brain-Computer Interfaces. I also worked on Object Detection and Proposal Generation during my third year when I was stationed at the Learning and Vision Lab @NUS.
