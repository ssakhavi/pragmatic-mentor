I love the guy for his insights.
When it comes to development, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to do exploratory learning via hobbies to learn general matters. However, It&amp;rsquo;s only when we do professional development based on the requirements of stakeholder that we learn the most and high quality code.
This is a selling point for the AI Singapore AIAP program, especially the 100E Program.</description></item><item><title>Code Aesthetics</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2023-02-02-code-aesthetic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 15:08:08 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2023-02-02-code-aesthetic/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was going through my twitter feed and saw uncle bob sharing a youtube video on &amp;ldquo;never nesters&amp;rdquo;.
When I saw the &amp;ldquo;never nesters&amp;rdquo; title, I thought to myself that this is possibly a video about code styles or how to
write clean code. Out of curioisty I went to the youtube channel and, lo and behold, I had found a gold mine: &lt;strong>Code Aesthetic&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This channel has done a few special things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It has explained problems with code from both a aesthetic point of view and also, from a technical point of view&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I love the simplicity of the video in terms of the content of each frame. You can read the code snippets and follow through the changes that are going to be eventually made.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The videos question some of the &amp;ldquo;norms&amp;rdquo; in coding. For example, the concept of &amp;ldquo;writing comments to explain code&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I immediately suscribed and added it to my Mailbrew Youtube list. I recommend you suscribe as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK1jWpLm2Ao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MLOps vs ML-As-Service // Jill Chase and Manmeet Gujral&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some interesting learning points:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MLaaS tend to be more B2C and MLOps is mainly B2B&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foundation Models have pushed the MLOps Frameworks to emphasize on the software&amp;rsquo;s ability to perform fine-tuning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MLOps revenue generation is not as fast as MLaaS but the contracts and projects are bigger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MLOps tends to lean towards providing for instances of Proprietary Data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

I want to clarify I have no intention of using this technology for monotization. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for generating knowledge and nothing else.
Functional Frameworks Are a Thing # Q: I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing machine learning frameworks such as JAX and functorch have been adopting functional programming paradigms. Is this true?
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true that some machine learning frameworks are adopting functional programming paradigms. This is because functional programming can help make it easier to write code that is concise, modular, and reusable, which can be useful when working on large machine learning projects.</description></item><item><title>Information- Processing, Organization and Retrieval</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2022-11-17-information-proc-org-rec/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:11:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2022-11-17-information-proc-org-rec/</guid><description>What do you store and how do you store it so later you can retrieve it ?
What am I sharing ? # I have a problem with finding the right information from the raw data I receive, organizing that information and also being able to retrieve the information in an optimal manner.
Let me give you an example to clarify a bit more.

Today, I had an awesome find!
One thing led to another #I was looking at my youtube subscriptions, and I saw video posted on the &amp;ldquo;Dev Interrupted&amp;rdquo; channel. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t subscribed to it, I highly recommend it. I recall I found the channel when Luca Rossi, the owner of the amazing &amp;ldquo;Refactoring&amp;rdquo; newsletter, mentioned it in one of the issues of his newsletter (Thanks Luca!</description></item><item><title>Being a Tech Lead at AISG</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2021-11-22-being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:18:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2021-11-22-being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since I joined AI Singapore and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for the experience so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a few projects up until now and gathered a lot of experience. My journey, however, is far from over and I have many things to learn.

The nature of the job is in a way that I have to mentor people and guide them to be better AI Engineers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I think my blog posts will be more relevant and useful.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic that came to my mind when I was thinking about how to teach people whether there ML system is robust enough or not.</description></item><item><title>Challenge: Decision Making</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-06-30-challenge-decision-making/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-06-30-challenge-decision-making/</guid><description>In this blog I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss one of the most difficult challenge that any architect will come across in their path to becoming professional: deciding on design and toold choices. For myself, this challenge reoccurs more and more often becuase of my own tendancy to making sure that my design is right and that I&amp;rsquo;m using the right tools. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s better that I delve into what I mean with an example.</description></item><item><title>The Beginning</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-04-03-the-beginning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-04-03-the-beginning/</guid><description>I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what title I can put on myself. Although, in my current comapny, I am considered to be the Lead AI Scientist but to be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means.
My background is machine learning and deep learning. I have worked on multiple aread of machine learning (some which I don&amp;rsquo;t have a paper). In my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, I was using machine learning to differentiate between a special type of evoked potentials in the brain called the &amp;ldquo;Error Potential&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/about/</guid><description>About Page</description></item><item><title>Favorites</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/favorites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/favorites/</guid><description>Some of my favorite things</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
