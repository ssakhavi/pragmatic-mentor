The task was simple: we have class A which is our desired class and everything else is background. This seems very simple and straightforward until a person like me starts thinking about how I can make the whole thing in the best way possible.</p><p>I had done this experiment before a year back and since then, I knew there were new tools that could be used to bring more &ldquo;structure&rdquo; into my code. So I started searching.</p><p>After some searching I came across a few frameweorks which are built on top of PyTorch and are designed to make life easier for those who don&rsquo;t want to have a lot of boilerplate code. You can find almost all of them in the <a href=https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/ target=_blank rel=noreferrer>PyTorch EcoSystem page</a>. After finding these amazingly well-designed frameworks, I had to make the tough decision: which one should I use.</p><h2 id=narrowing-it-down class="relative group">Narrowing it down <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#narrowing-it-down aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>Here it got a bit tricky: I was trying to find something to use which was easy to plug into my current code and at the same time, had structure. My philosophy is that a good framework is a framework which enforces structure. That&rsquo;s why after looking at the examples and source code, I narrowed down my options to two: <strong>PyTorch Lightning (PL)</strong> and <strong>Catalyst</strong>.</p><p>Initially, I had a tough time; Both frameworks are amazing and they cover a lot of the boilerplate code and give some degrees of autmation. Catalysy even has a example on how to use their framework for segmentation. But in order to come up with a decision, I decided to to implement the segmentation algorithm in both frameworks.</p><p>One of the things that was intriguing about PL and eventually led to me deciding on this framework, was the way it was implemented: The whole framework was a python class which needed its abstract methods to be populated based on the problem in hand. This was exactly what I was looking for. After populating the class (PL module), a simple method was executed with the intended parameters and logging methods. This really helps with making the training modular as possible, which is one of the needs for a flexible architecture. I saw this benefit when I tried mixing <a href=https://hydra.cc/ target=_blank rel=noreferrer>hydra</a> with my PL code. It was supper easy because the parameter values were already being passed as a dicitonary and I just needed to pass them as <code>DictConfig</code> (the type of the Hydra parameter dictionary based on OmegaConf).</p><p>Then I added MLFlow into the mix. This was another reason I selected PL: It had a built-in MLFlow logger. By adding MLFlow, I found a <a href=https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/2058 target=_blank rel=noreferrer>bug</a> which most likely was spotted because of the use of Hydra and MLFlow together. This resulted in a <a href=https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/2216 target=_blank rel=noreferrer>PR</a>. I really don&rsquo;t know if it was a bug or not because it was possible that upgrading the versions of my python packages would solve the problem, but they updated the code in a way that solved it entirely.</p><h2 id=takeaways class="relative group">Takeaways <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#takeaways aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>My Takeaways from this experience:</p><ul><li>Believe in a philosophy or an ideal regarding how code should look like.</li><li>Narrow down options by intially reading through the documents and sample code</li><li>After narrowing down, impelement the raw version of your code in the options you have and see the benefits and caveats</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be shy to submit issues or PRs on GitHub (I submitted a PR, panicked and deleted my code and one of the owners asked that why I did that)</li></ul><p>Take care.</p></div></section><footer class="max-w-prose pt-8 print:hidden"><div class=flex><div class=place-self-center><div class="text-2xl sm:text-lg"></div></div></div><div class=pt-8><hr class="border-dotted border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-600"><div class="flex justify-between pt-3"><span><a class="group flex" href=/posts/2020-04-03-the-beginning/><span class="me-2 text-neutral-700 transition-transform group-hover:-translate-x-[2px] group-hover:text-primary-600 dark:text-neutral dark:group-hover:text-primary-400"><span class="ltr:inline rtl:hidden">&larr;</span><span class="ltr:hidden rtl:inline">&rarr;</span></span>
