        In my last post, I was shared what my concerns were regarding software development and what my role as a Tech Lead should look at AISG.
Today, I had an awesome find!
One thing led to another #I was looking at my youtube subscriptions, and I saw video posted on the &ldquo;Dev Interrupted&rdquo; channel. If you aren&rsquo;t subscribed to it, I highly recommend it. I recall I found the channel when Luca Rossi, the owner of the amazing &ldquo;Refactoring&rdquo; newsletter, mentioned it in one of the issues of his newsletter (Thanks Luca!

Luca Rossi, the owner of the amazing <a href=https://refactoring.fm/ target=_blank rel=noreferrer>&ldquo;Refactoring&rdquo;</a> newsletter, mentioned
it in one of the issues of his newsletter (Thanks Luca!).</p><p>The video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70tFglJMkQw" target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Evaluating and Understanding Constraints in Software Engineering</a>
was actually a clip from a <a href=https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/lessons-learned-from-programming-at-google-part-1/ target=_blank rel=noreferrer>podcast interview</a>
in June 2021. The title of the video didn&rsquo;t click with me at first. When I opened it and listened. They were talking about
constraints that are needed during software engineering (something I personally believe in).</p><p>I searched the names of the interviewees and found out they were the authors of the book
<strong>&ldquo;Software Engineering at Google&rdquo;</strong>. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;d seen this book on
different websites and how much I wanted to read it. Unfortunately, I would always de-prioritize
it on my reading list. I went to the book on my O&rsquo;Reilly account, opened the TOC and then,
my jaw dropped. The TOC was almost all of the things I wrote down in <a href=../being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg>my previous post</a> and more.</p><p>To my amazement, the book is also shared for free on their <a href=https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book target=_blank rel=noreferrer>website</a>.</p><h2 id=how-am-i-going-to-go-from-here class="relative group">How am I going to go from here? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#how-am-i-going-to-go-from-here aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>This new finding is very precious.
