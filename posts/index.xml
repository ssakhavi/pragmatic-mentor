What am I sharing ? I have a problem with finding the right information from the raw data I receive, organizing that information and also being able to retrieve the information in an optimal manner.
Let me give you an example to clarify a bit more.
Example Scenario: Daily Standup Scenario: I have a standup meeting with my team almost every day.</description></item><item><title>Found It!: Software Engineering at Google</title><link>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/software-eng-at-google/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:03:28 +0800</pubDate><author>Siavash Sakhavi</author><guid>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/software-eng-at-google/</guid><description><![CDATA[In my last post, I was shared what my concerns were regarding software development and what my role as a Tech Lead should look at AISG.
Today, I had an awesome find!
One thing led to another I was looking at my youtube subscriptions, and I saw video posted on the &ldquo;Dev Interrupted&rdquo; channel. If you aren&rsquo;t subscribed to it, I highly recommend it. I recall I found the channel when Luca Rossi, the owner of the amazing &ldquo;Refactoring&rdquo; newsletter, mentioned it in one of the issues of his newsletter (Thanks Luca!]]></description></item><item><title>Being a Tech Lead at AISG</title><link>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:18:45 +0800</pubDate><author>Siavash Sakhavi</author><guid>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/being-a-tech-lead-at-aisg/</guid><description><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s been a year since I joined AI Singapore and I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience so far. I&rsquo;ve been on a few projects up until now and gathered a lot of experience. My journey, however, is far from over and I have many things to learn.
What am I suppose to do? I remember when I started my job, I asked my supervisor: What is my role as a &ldquo;Senior Engineer&rdquo;?]]></description></item><item><title>Breaking the Code to Learn</title><link>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/2020-11-25-breaking-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Siavash Sakhavi</author><guid>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/2020-11-25-breaking-to-learn/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new job at AI Singapore. The nature of the job is in a way that I have to mentor people and guide them to be better AI Engineers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I think my blog posts will be more relevant and useful.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic that came to my mind when I was thinking about how to teach people whether there ML system is robust enough or not.</description></item><item><title>Challenge: Decision Making</title><link>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/2020-06-30-challenge-decision-making/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Siavash Sakhavi</author><guid>https://blog.siavashsakhavi.com/2020-06-30-challenge-decision-making/</guid><description>In this blog I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss one of the most difficult challenge that any architect will come across in their path to becoming professional: deciding on design and toold choices. For myself, this challenge reoccurs more and more often becuase of my own tendancy to making sure that my design is right and that I&amp;rsquo;m using the right tools.

Although, in my current comapny, I am considered to be the Lead AI Scientist but to be honest, I don&rsquo;t know what that means.
My background is machine learning and deep learning. I have worked on multiple aread of machine learning (some which I don&rsquo;t have a paper).
