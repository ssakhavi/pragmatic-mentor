I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a few projects up until now and gathered a lot of experience. My journey, however, is far from over and I have many things to learn.
What am I suppose to do? #I remember when I started my job, I asked my supervisor: What is my role as a &amp;ldquo;Senior Engineer&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>Breaking the Code to Learn</title><link>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-11-25-breaking-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pragmatic-mentor.xyz/posts/2020-11-25-breaking-to-learn/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new job at AI Singapore.
